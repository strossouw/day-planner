# Day Planner Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a day planner. The planner should highlight the current hour. It should also indicate time slots that have passed along with time slots in the future. This will only show the current date.

## How to use

Choose time slot that you need to indicate something in the schedule. Click in the blank box to allow text editing. Once text has been edited, click save.

To edit the text, click the box again then edit the text and click save again. 

Refreshing the page will not cause data loss.


## How it works
Starter code was implemented.

The predetermined style classes were implemented. 

Time of day is calculated and compared against hour block. 
This will determine if the hour is past, current, or future.
It will apply attributes to the time-block as appropriate.
